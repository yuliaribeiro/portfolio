# 🌱 Ju's Portfolio - Welcome

Hi There! My name is Ju, this repository is dedicated to build my portfolio.

Feel free to explore the code and documentation to better understand my development workflow, problem-solving approach, and coding standards. 

If you're evaluating my work, this README will guide you through the most relevant parts of the codebase, agile methodology applied and how to find the information.

This portfolie ensures the mobile-first layout concept.

Let's Get Start!

## 📌 Agile Methodology & Project Organization
This project follows Agile principles to guide the development process in an iterative and incremental way. All planning and task tracking are managed using [GitHub Projects](https://github.com/users/yuliaribeiro/projects/3) — feel free to explore the board to follow the progress.


### 🧠 Project Board Structure

The board is organized using a **Kanban layout** with the following columns:
- **Backlog**: Ideas or features that might be added in the future.
- **To Do**: Features and tasks that are planned and ready to be worked on.
- **In Progress**: Tasks currently being developed.
- **Done**: Completed tasks.


### 🧩 Feature-Based Breakdown

Each **Feature** represents a key part of the portfolio and is tracked as a separate Issue. Within each feature, I break down the work into **small, actionable tasks**. This helps demonstrate my ability to decompose larger problems into manageable units.

This approach not only improves productivity and focus but also makes the development process more transparent and easier to follow.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

This project uses a modern and efficient front-end stack designed for performance, scalability, and code quality.

### ⚙️ Core Stack
- **[Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)** – Lightning-fast build tool and development server.
- **[React](https://reactjs.org/)** – UI library for building interactive user interfaces.
- **[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)** – Superset of JavaScript that adds static typing and improves developer experience.

### 🎨 Styling
- **[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)** – Utility-first CSS framework for fast and responsive UI development.

### 🧹 Code Quality
- **[ESLint](https://eslint.org/)** – Linter to enforce consistent code style and catch common bugs.
- **[Prettier](https://prettier.io/)** – Code formatter to ensure consistent styling across the project.

### ✅ Testing
- **[Vitest](https://vitest.dev/)** – Blazing-fast unit testing framework built for Vite, with a Jest-compatible API.

All of these tools work together to ensure the codebase is clean, well-structured, and easy to maintain.
