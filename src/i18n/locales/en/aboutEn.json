        "I'm a passionate frontend developer driven by a simple principle: great user experiences start with great code.",
        "With over 3 years of hands-on experience in React, TypeScript, and modern web technologies, I transform ideas into robust, scalable, and elegant solutions. I don't just ship features—I build interfaces that are intuitive, accessible, and designed to perform at scale.",
        "Beyond code, I bring a mindset of ownership, collaboration, and continuous improvement. I thrive in agile environments, contribute actively to technical discussions, and value clean, tested, and well-documented code as a foundation for long-term success.",
        "If you're looking for someone who will care as much about your product as you do—who combines technical skill with strategic thinking—I’d love to hear from you."
